Usage:			r = VaRDGdecompG(l)

Input:

 - l: a list with (at least) the components Delta, Gamma, B
 - Delta: (m x 1) 'old' first derivatives 
 - Gamma: (m x m) 'old' second derivatives 
 - B:  (m x m) square root of the covariance matrix, BB' = Sigma


Output:

 - r: a list containing the additional components delta and lambda
 - delta: '(m x 1) new first derivatives'
 - lambda: '(m x m) diagonal of the new second derivatives'

Example:

 'Delta = c(1,2,3) 
 Gamma = matrix(1,3,3) + diag(rep(9,3)) 
 B = diag(rep(1,3)) 
 l = list() 
 l$Delta = Delta 
 l$Gamma = Gamma 
 l$B = B 
 VaRDGdecompG(l)'
