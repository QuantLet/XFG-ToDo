Description:		'DGdecompS computes the square root of a positive semi-definite matrix, using an eigen value decomposition. Notes: Square roots of matrices can also be computed by the Cholesky decomposition, which only works for positive definite matrices, but which is faster.'

Keywords:		Cholesky decomposition, eigenvalue-decomposition, square root matrix

Usage:			B = DGdecompS(Sigma)

Input:

Sigmap x p- positive semi-definite matrix containing user-defined data

Output:

Bp x p - matrix containing the square root of Sigma. 
 Note that the solution is non-unique. B solves the equation: 
 BB' = Sigma.

Example:

Sigma = matrix(1,3,3) + diag(rep(10,3)) 
 B = DGdecompS(Sigma) 
 B 
 B%*%t(B)
