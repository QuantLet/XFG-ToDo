Usage:			'r = VaRcorrfDGF2(x,l)'

Input:			
 - x: the argument to the CDF
 - l: a list defining the distribution, contains at least theta, delta, lambda
 - theta: the constant 
 - delta: the linear term 
 - lambda: the diagonal of the quadratic term

Output:

- r:  the value of the approximated normal CDF at x
