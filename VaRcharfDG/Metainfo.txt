Usage:			'r = VaRcharfDG(t,par)'

Input:			
 -t: the complex argument to the cgf
 -par: a list defining the distribution# contains the components theta, delta, lambda 
 -theta: the constant term 
 -delta: the linear term 
 -lambda: the diagonal of the quadratic term

Output: 		
- r: the value of the cgf at t

Example: 'Plots the real (blue line) and the imaginary part (red line) of the characteristic function for a distribution, which is close to a chi^2 distribution with one degree of freedom.'
